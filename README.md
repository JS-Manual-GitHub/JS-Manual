The above mouse is performing a self-paced center out joystick task for a fluid reward. Following a successful reach, there is a delay to reward followed by fluid delivery and then an intertrial interval. The task is written in C++ for Arduino and uses Switch Case logic defined by “Event Markers”.  As seen in the left, the Event Marker changes with the task performance; 0 : waiting for reach,  1 : delay to reward, 2 : fluid delivery and 3: intertrial interval.
